**JS Project Proposal**

Portugal Trade Data Visualization


**Background**

Portugal trade involves export and import data.

This project is to visualize such data with regards to each trade partner using d3.js, and to provide UI for users to interact with such data.


**Functionality & MVPs**

With this Portugal Trade Data Visualization App, users will be able to:

Select a specific trade partner on a map

Browse the trade data specifically to the trade partner

Filter trade partners on a map with user input

View a chart where it shows the percentage of each partner’s contribution to the total trade


In addition, this project will include:

    An About modal describing the background and user instructions
    
    A production README


**Wireframes**

    In the middle, there will be a world map on which users can browse each trade partner of Portugal.

    At the top, there will be a control section for filtering trade partners based on user input.

    At the bottom, there will be a view chart section for users to see the percentage of each partner’s contribution to the total trade.


**Technologies, Libraries, APIs**

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

    d3.js to display a world map, filters, and a view chart

    Webpack and Babel to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code
    
    npm to manage project dependencies


**Implementation Timeline**

    Friday & Weekend: Setup project, getting webpack up and running. Get the world map to show up on the screen, and spend time getting comfortable with d3.js.

    Monday: Create a browsing functionality on the world map to enable users to look at each trade partner’s data in detail.

    Tuesday: Use d3.js to filter trade partners on the world map, based on users input.

    Wednesday: Display view chart for users to see the percentage of each partner’s contribution to the total trade.

    Thursday Morning: Continue working on the project if it is not complete. Deploy to Github pages. If time, rewrite this proposal as a production README.
